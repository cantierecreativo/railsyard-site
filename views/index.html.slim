      h3 Designed to get out of your way.
      markdown:
        Forget clumsy backend UI experiences filled with tons of settings and
        complexity you didn't request.

        With Railsyard you can finally craft a back-end that fits exactly your client's
        mental model of how a website should be edited: not a single checkbox
        more.

    li
      h3 Each website is different: so should be the backend.
      markdown:
        Someone had to stop this "pages-articles-and-comments" clich√©. CMSs should be
        able to easily handle any type of content, not just the standard cases.
        Railsyard can build a backend for any model and relations you can think
        of, in the same ~30 lines of code.

    li
      h3 100% Extensible and reusable
      markdown:
        The Railsyard core is and will always remain content-agnostic. Image galleries,
        rich-text editing, automatic image resize, translations, data exporting,
        authentication, authorization? Each of these things could be implemented in
        thousands of different ways, based on the requirements of the project.

        That's why we built them as plugins: use the ones we provide, or throw them
        away, build something completely different and share it with the community.

    li
      h3 Built on top of production-ready, popular gems
      markdown:
        Rails and gems like CanCan, SimpleForm, Friendly Id, Dragonfly and Globalize
        makes it already easy to build a backend in no time.

        Railsyard refuses to reinvent the wheel again: is just a tiny layer above them.
        This means less stuff to maintain for us, and less new stuff for you to learn.

    li
      h3 Rails 3.2+ compatible
      markdown:
        Railsyard is a mountable, isolated Rails 3 engine built from the ground up to
        take advantage of all the latest Rails conventions, asset pipeline included.
        This makes it easy to use it side by side with other engines, such as Spree.

  #slideshow
    nav
      == link_to "Previous step", "#", class: "prev"
      == link_to "Next step", "#", class: "next"

            ### Step 1. Install it
            Railsyard is just a simple gem that implements a Rails 3 mountable engine.
            Add it to your `Gemfile` and then `bundle` it up.
        pre data-src="new-rails.sh" data-language="bash"

      li
        .caption
          markdown:
            ### Step 2. Generate your Rails models
            Just like the Rails `scaffold` CLI method, you can prepare a backend section for a certain model.
        pre data-src="scaffold.sh" data-language="bash"

      li
        .caption
          markdown:
            ### Step 3. Customize the backend
            Editors is where you can customize every aspect of your backend. Think
            of editors as "super-smart views". For each model you can define which
            fields to show and which to make editable.

        pre data-src="editor.rb" data-language="ruby"
